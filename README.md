# springboot-kotlin-starter

This repository provides a basic example of a Spring Boot (Spring MVC)
application in Kotlin, using an H2 database. Flyway DB Migrations are enabled,
and scripts are provided in the main resources folder.

A gradle wrapper is included in the project root. To run the app, you can use `gradlew bootRun`.
By default, it will run on port 9090.
